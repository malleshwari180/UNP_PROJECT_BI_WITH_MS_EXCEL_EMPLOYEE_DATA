# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_EMPLOYEE_DATA

UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_EMPLOYEE_DATA.xlsx: I created this dashboard in collaboration with UNP Education.

The dataset provides detailed employee information for business intelligence purposes.
It includes fields like Employee ID, Name, Gender, Age, Department, and Salary.
Data on employee performance, job role, and years of experience is also available.
The dataset helps analyze workforce demographics and departmental distribution.
Salary variations across departments and experience levels can be examined.
Gender representation and age trends can be visualized using charts in Excel.
It's ideal for creating pivot tables and dashboards to support HR decision-making.
